# Poor Man's OSQuery

An abandoned project that used only commonly pre-installed Unix CLI tools to
generate MySQL files containing operating system information. See
`source/schema` to see all of the things this queries.

I strategically abandoned this project because it was too difficult to get it
working across diverse systems.
